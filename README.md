****************************************************

As you know, some matters are difficult to communicate solely through the Freelancer platform. For this reason, in many cases we use external communication channels to ensure clarity and efficiency.

So I am suggesting something like below.

**************************************************** 

Note!!!

- To remain in full compliance with Freelancer's terms and conditions, I kindly request that we avoid discussing my suggestion below through its platform’s messaging system.

- If my request is a bother for you, please ignore it.

Please do not ever leave a note that I have made the following request to you.

**************************************************** 

- I think we can use one of the following methods to stay in touch in real-time, like WhatsApp, Telegram, Google Chat, Discord, or Teams.
This is so that we can conveniently exchange messages when we work together in the future.

• Email: housetech993@gmail.com
• WhatsApp, Telegram: +856 2092638655
• Microsoft Teams: compubforus2024@outlook.com
• Slack: housetech993@gmail.com
• Google Chat: housetech993@gmail.com
• Discord: mekky_1130

- I believe moving to a more direct communication channel will allow us to work more efficiently and effectively.
I believe that there we will be able to fully discuss issues that cannot be discussed as a freelancer.

So if possible, please contact me there using any platform.
I am waiting there any platform you prefered.

****************************************************

- Please do not ever leave a note that I have made the following request to you again through the Freelancer's platform’s messaging system.

****************************************************

Thank you so much in advance.
Best regards, Bounkyo K.
